abstract  = "ABSTRACT: Low-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems
              have seen a renaissance recently due to improvements in
              technology (both hardware and software). Originally, the
              performance of low-field MRI systems was rated lower than their
              actual clinical usefulness, and they were viewed as low-cost but
              poorly performing systems. However, various applications similar
              to high-field MRI systems (1.5 T and 3 T) have gradually become
              possible, culminating with high-performance low-field MRI
              systems and their adaptations now being proposed that have
              unique advantages over high-field MRI systems in various
              aspects. This review article describes the physical
              characteristics of low-field MRI systems and presents both their
              advantages and disadvantages for clinical use (past to present),

abstract = {Abstract NMR Mandhalas (Magnetic Arrangement for Novel Discrete Halbach LAyout) are arrays of identically shaped magnets in a Halbach-type arrangement. They provide a simple and cost-effective way to generate high magnetic fields for mobile applications, for example, in magnetic resonance. Based on the introductory publication by Raich and Blümler (Concepts Magn Reson 2004;23B:16–25), we extend the notion of Mandhalas from cube-shaped magnets to polygonal and cylindrical ones and present construction guidelines for the stacking of such rings to generate homogeneous magnetic fields over larger volumes. For this purpose, we present formulas and numerical values based on a dipole approach to calculate the flux density of single rings and composed 3D systems and compare to corresponding results obtained by 3D boundary element method calculations. As an application of the approach presented here, we constructed prototypes. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Concepts Magn Reson Part A 36A: 211–222, 2010.},

abtract={Low-field (B<sub>0</sub> < 0.2 T) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is emerging as a low cost, point-of-care alternative to provide access to diagnostic imaging technology even in resource scarce environments. MRI magnets can be constructed based on permanent neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnets in discretized arrangements, leading to substantially lower mass and costs. A challenge with these designs is, however, a good B<sub>0</sub> field homogeneity, which is needed to produce high quality images free of distortions. In this work, we describe an iterative approach to build a low-field MR magnet based on a B<sub>0</sub>-shimming methodology using genetic algorithms. The methodology is tested by constructing a small bore (inner bore diameter = 130 mm) desktop MR magnet (<15 kg) at a field strength of B<sub>0</sub> = 0.1 T and a target volume of 4 cm in diameter. The configuration consists of a base magnet and shim inserts, which can be placed iteratively without modifying the base magnet assembly and without changing the inner dimensions of the bore or the outer dimensions of the MR magnet. Applying the shims, B<sub>0</sub> field inhomogeneity could be reduced by a factor 8 from 5,448 to 682 ppm in the target central slice of the magnet. Further improvements of these results can be achieved in a second or third iteration, using more sensitive magnetic field probes (e.g., nuclear magnetic resonance based magnetic field measurements). The presented methodology is scalable to bigger magnet designs. The MR magnet can be reproduced with off-the-shelf components and a 3D printer and no special tools are needed for construction. All design files and code to reproduce the results will be made available as open source hardware.}

               on both phantoms and in vivo.ResultsPhantom results showed that
               the gradient nonlinearity in the y‐direction and z‐direction was
               less than 5\% over a 15‐cm FOV and did not need correcting. For
               the x‐direction, it was significantly greater, but could be
               partially corrected in postprocessing. Three‐dimensional in vivo
               scans of the brain of a healthy volunteer using a turbo
               spin‐echo sequence were acquired at a spatial resolution of 4
               $\times$ 4 $\times$ 4 mm in a time of about 2 minutes. The
               T1‐weighted and T2‐weighted scans showed a good degree of tissue

               to maximize signal and resolution while minimizing scan time.
               However, high‐field devices remain expensive to install and
               operate, making them scarce outside of high‐income countries and
               major population centers. Low‐field strength scanners have drawn
               renewed academic, industry, and philanthropic interest due to
               advantages that could dramatically increase imaging access,
               including lower cost and portability. Nevertheless, low‐field
               MRI still faces inherent limitations in image quality that come
               with decreased signal. In this article, we review advantages and
               disadvantages of low‐field MRI scanners, describe hardware and
               software innovations that accentuate advantages and mitigate
               disadvantages, and consider clinical applications for a new
               generation of low‐field devices. In our review, we explore how
               these devices are being or could be used for high acuity brain
               imaging, outpatient neuroimaging, MRI‐guided procedures,
               pediatric imaging, and musculoskeletal imaging. Challenges for

               are used in many different applications. System design has
               correspondingly different requirements in terms of imaging
               field-of-view, spatial resolution and magnetic field strength.
               In this work an iterative framework has been created to design a
               cylindrical Halbach-based magnet along with integrated gradient
               and RF coils that most efficiently fulfil a set of
               user-specified imaging requirements.MethodsFor efficient
               integration, target field methods are used for each of the main
               hardware components. These have not been used previously in
               magnet design, and a new mathematical model was derived
               accordingly. These methods result in a framework which can
               design an entire low-field MRI system within minutes using
               standard computing hardware.ResultsTwo distinct point-of-care
               systems are designed using the described framework, one for

               respect to the desired imaging parameters taking into account
               the interdependencies between these components and thus give
