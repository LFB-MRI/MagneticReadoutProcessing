abstract  = "ABSTRACT: Low-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems
              have seen a renaissance recently due to improvements in
              technology (both hardware and software). Originally, the
              performance of low-field MRI systems was rated lower than their
              actual clinical usefulness, and they were viewed as low-cost but
              poorly performing systems. However, various applications similar
              to high-field MRI systems (1.5 T and 3 T) have gradually become
              possible, culminating with high-performance low-field MRI
              systems and their adaptations now being proposed that have
              unique advantages over high-field MRI systems in various
              aspects. This review article describes the physical
              characteristics of low-field MRI systems and presents both their
              advantages and disadvantages for clinical use (past to present),
              along with their cutting-edge clinical applications.",

abstract = {Abstract NMR Mandhalas (Magnetic Arrangement for Novel Discrete Halbach LAyout) are arrays of identically shaped magnets in a Halbach-type arrangement. They provide a simple and cost-effective way to generate high magnetic fields for mobile applications, for example, in magnetic resonance. Based on the introductory publication by Raich and Blümler (Concepts Magn Reson 2004;23B:16–25), we extend the notion of Mandhalas from cube-shaped magnets to polygonal and cylindrical ones and present construction guidelines for the stacking of such rings to generate homogeneous magnetic fields over larger volumes. For this purpose, we present formulas and numerical values based on a dipole approach to calculate the flux density of single rings and composed 3D systems and compare to corresponding results obtained by 3D boundary element method calculations. As an application of the approach presented here, we constructed prototypes. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Concepts Magn Reson Part A 36A: 211–222, 2010.},

abtract={Low-field (B<sub>0</sub> < 0.2 T) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is emerging as a low cost, point-of-care alternative to provide access to diagnostic imaging technology even in resource scarce environments. MRI magnets can be constructed based on permanent neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnets in discretized arrangements, leading to substantially lower mass and costs. A challenge with these designs is, however, a good B<sub>0</sub> field homogeneity, which is needed to produce high quality images free of distortions. In this work, we describe an iterative approach to build a low-field MR magnet based on a B<sub>0</sub>-shimming methodology using genetic algorithms. The methodology is tested by constructing a small bore (inner bore diameter = 130 mm) desktop MR magnet (<15 kg) at a field strength of B<sub>0</sub> = 0.1 T and a target volume of 4 cm in diameter. The configuration consists of a base magnet and shim inserts, which can be placed iteratively without modifying the base magnet assembly and without changing the inner dimensions of the bore or the outer dimensions of the MR magnet. Applying the shims, B<sub>0</sub> field inhomogeneity could be reduced by a factor 8 from 5,448 to 682 ppm in the target central slice of the magnet. Further improvements of these results can be achieved in a second or third iteration, using more sensitive magnetic field probes (e.g., nuclear magnetic resonance based magnetic field measurements). The presented methodology is scalable to bigger magnet designs. The MR magnet can be reproduced with off-the-shelf components and a 3D printer and no special tools are needed for construction. All design files and code to reproduce the results will be made available as open source hardware.}

              system capable of obtaining in vivo MR images within a

              magnet array with a clear bore diameter of 27 cm was designed
              for operation at 50 mT. Custom-built gradient coils, RF coil,
              gradient amplifiers, and RF amplifier were integrated and tested
              on both phantoms and in vivo.ResultsPhantom results showed that
              the gradient nonlinearity in the y-direction and z-direction was
              less than 5\% over a 15-cm FOV and did not need correcting. For
              the x-direction, it was significantly greater, but could be
              partially corrected in postprocessing. Three-dimensional in vivo
              scans of the brain of a healthy volunteer using a turbo
              spin-echo sequence were acquired at a spatial resolution of 4
              $\times$ 4 $\times$ 4 mm in a time of about 2 minutes. The
              T1-weighted and T2-weighted scans showed a good degree of tissue
              contrast. In addition, in vivo scans of the knee of a healthy
              volunteer were acquired at a spatial resolution of about 3
              $\times$ 2 $\times$ 2 mm within 12 minutes to show the

              which is able to acquire human images in vivo within a
              reasonable data-acquisition time. The system has a high degree

abstract  = "Modern MRI scanners have trended toward higher field strengths
              to maximize signal and resolution while minimizing scan time.
              However, high-field devices remain expensive to install and
              operate, making them scarce outside of high-income countries and
              major population centers. Low-field strength scanners have drawn
              renewed academic, industry, and philanthropic interest due to
              advantages that could dramatically increase imaging access,
              including lower cost and portability. Nevertheless, low-field
              MRI still faces inherent limitations in image quality that come
              with decreased signal. In this article, we review advantages and
              disadvantages of low-field MRI scanners, describe hardware and
              software innovations that accentuate advantages and mitigate
              disadvantages, and consider clinical applications for a new
              generation of low-field devices. In our review, we explore how
              these devices are being or could be used for high acuity brain
              imaging, outpatient neuroimaging, MRI-guided procedures,
              pediatric imaging, and musculoskeletal imaging. Challenges for

              correspondingly different requirements in terms of imaging
              field-of-view, spatial resolution and magnetic field strength.
              In this work an iterative framework has been created to design a
              cylindrical Halbach-based magnet along with integrated gradient
              and RF coils that most efficiently fulfil a set of
              user-specified imaging requirements.MethodsFor efficient

              hardware components. These have not been used previously in
              magnet design, and a new mathematical model was derived

Our research shows that devices differ not only in average latency, but also in the distribution of their latencies, and that forced polling at 1000 Hz decreases latency for some but not all devices. Existing practices - measuring end-to-end latency as a proxy of input latency and reporting only mean values and standard deviations - hide these characteristic latency distributions caused by device intrinsics and polling rates. A probabilistic model of input device latency demonstrates these issues and matches our measurements. Thus, our work offers guidance for researchers, engineers, and hobbyists who want to measure the latency of input devices or select devices with low latency.},

              easy to use shim array that can be employed with the standard 7
              T head coil. The array was interfaced using an open-source
              eight-channel shim amplifier rack. Improvements in field
              homogeneity for whole-brain and slice-based shimming were
              compared to standard second-order shimming, and to more complex
              higher order dynamic shimming and shim arrays with 32 and 48
              channels. Results The eight-channel shim array provided 12\%
              improvement in whole brain static shimming and provided 33\%
              improvement when using slice-based shimming. With this, the
              eight-channel array performed similar to third-order dynamic
              shimming (without the need for higher order eddy current
              compensation). More complex shim arrays with 32 and 48 channels
              performed better, but require a dedicated RF coil. Discussion
              The designed eight-channel shim array provides a low-complexity
              and low-cost approach for improving B0 field shimming on an
              ultra-high field system. In both static and dynamic shimming, it
              provides improved B0 homogeneity over standard shimming.",

abstract={High-resolution magnetic field probes based on pulsed liquid-state NMR are presented. Static field measurements with an error of 10 nanotesla or less at 3 tesla are readily obtained in 100 ms. The further ability to measure dynamic magnetic fields results from using small ( approximately 1 microL) droplets of MR-active liquid surrounded by susceptibility-matched materials. The consequent high field homogeneity allows free induction decay signals lasting 100 ms or more to be readily achieved. The small droplet dimensions allow the magnetic field to be measured even in the presence of large gradients. Highly sensitive detection yields sufficient SNR to follow the relevant field evolution without signal averaging and at bandwidths up to hundreds of kHz. Transient, nonreproducible effects and drifts are thus readily monitored. The typical application of k-space trajectory mapping has been demonstrated. Potential further applications include characterization, tuning, and maintenance of gradient systems as well as the mapping of the static field distribution of MRI magnets. Connection of the probes to a standard MR spectrometer is similar to that used for imaging coils.},

title={Characterization of CMOS Image Sensor},
abstract={CMOS image sensors comprises of two process: designing and measurement/testing. CMOS image sensors are designed with certain characteristic performance and it is important to measure these characteristics accurately. CMOS image sensor convert light information into digital information which can be reproduced in form of an image. Conventional 4T pixel with pinned photodiode is a popular choice for designing image sensor; with certain modification in the pixel architecture better characteristic performance can be achieved with trade-offs. Quantum efficiency, linearity, full-well capacity, conversion gain, noise, non-uniformity, dark current, modulation transfer function and image lag are main characterises of CMOS image sensor. Quantum efficiency defines the efficiency of the image sensor and ideally it should be 100 percent i.e. 1electron-hole pair for every photon incident with linear photo response. Higher full-well capacity means more number of electrons that can be generated which results in higher dynamic range and better signal to noise ratio. Conversion gain tells the efficiency of signal processing unit, higher the better. Noise sets the dynamic range of the image sensor by defining the lower limit of signal level, continuous advances have been made to reduce the noise and some image sensor can achieve noise level of 1e-. Modulation transfer function defines the spatial resolution of the image sensor, which is also the measure of optical crosstalk of the image sensor. Another characteristic which is more of an advantage over CCD image sensor is image lag which is also known as memory effect; defines the image sensors ability to transfer charge from photodiode to floating diffusion. These characteristic parameters define the CMOS image sensor and having a standard measurement procedure for computing this characteristic is necessary. This report presents the standard measurement procedure to characterize CMOS image sensor. This project is an internal project for Caeleste CVBA, Mechelen, Belgium, hence the measurement procedures are more specific to Caeleste requirement and follows EMVA 1288 standards. Measurement procedure includes all the details to evaluate the characteristic parameter: measurement background, block diagram, procedure and data processing are some of key elements of the procedures. We at Caeleste performed different methods to compute a characteristic parameter accurately and precisely. Also software library and hardware tools were updated for improving measurement accuracy and speed.},
