Motivation for ``MagneticReadoutProcessing``
********************************************

This library was created for the Low-Field Breast MRI project and allows processing of data measured by magnetic field sensors.
The focus is on visualization, followed by the provision of simple interfaces to work with this data.


Limitations
***********

The current state of the Python module is in alpha status.
It offers rudimentary functions:

- Only spherical scans are possible

- recording of raw data including metadata

- visualization of recorded raw data

- export/import

- conversion of data into ``numpy`` compatible formats
