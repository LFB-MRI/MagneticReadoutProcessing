# MagneticReadoutProcessing

MagneticReadoutProcessing is a Python library that makes it possible to store and further process raw data from magnetometers. The focus is on the processing of point clouds, on which the points are located on a circular path around a magnetic object to be viewed. Measurement data (hemisphere) can later be combined into a full 3D scan, visualized and compared with reference measurements.
